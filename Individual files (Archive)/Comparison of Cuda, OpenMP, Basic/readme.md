# Comparison of Cuda, OpenMP and Basic version 

Though the implementations in this folder are not the most optimised, they have been written for fair comparison of the 3 versions.  

The changes incorporated include:  
* Vector of int instead of bit array  
* Storing words in character array instead of vector of strings
